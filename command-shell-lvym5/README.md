# cs232-shell-assignment

There are a couple of instructions at the top of the shell.py file as comments. 
Here are the notes: 
1. Run in Python3 
2. Sometimes the exit function doesn't work if I had previously entered an invalid command and then try to exit the program. It works on the second try though.
